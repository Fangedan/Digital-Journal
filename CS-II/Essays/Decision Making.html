    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Below I will be analyzing five different decision making biases that could have potentially impacted me and/or my ISP team's decision making process. I will further explain how I personally intend to overcome each of the biases I describe.</p>

     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">1. COMPLETENESS</p>
     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">"The perception of an apparently complete or logical data presentation can stop the search for omissions" (Fischhoff, Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1978; Hogarth, 1987). The completeness bias is essentially the ideology that if a proposal seems as if it covers all aspects or potential consequences, it must be definitive, or more complete than its competitors. The bias also contains another aspect which has an extremely similar effect as beforementioned, only the requisite is that the proposal follows a logical or believable line of reasoning. A study conducted by Fischhoff, Slovic, Lichtenstein, and Hogarth exemplifies this bias; managers presented with two random graphs detailing sales estimates and asked which seemed to be more plausible, the majority picked the graph which was rounded to the nearest dollar as opposed to the one rounded to the nearest $500,000. This is a prime example of the completeness bias because both graphs are equally plausible for sales estimates, yet many picked the one rounded to the nearest dollar as "more plausible" simply because of its orientation. Personally, I believe that there was a definite completeness bias that potentially impacted my ISP team's decision to pick my proposal. This is because my website for the proposal was, on average, neater, well formatted, and contained more information when compared to others' business proposals. Accounting for the reality of completeness bias, it would be plausible that I had a relatively large number of people join my ISP simply because it appeared more complete. However, I plan to combat the potential negative side effects of this bias by personally ensuring that the finished product will be as quality as promised. Though slightly tyrannical, I will make sure my teammates are completing their designated tasks on time and expect responsibility from each of them. This way, the project will not turn out to be mediocre and match the exceptional expectations that the proposal displayed. </p>

     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">2. COMPLEXITY</p>
     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">"Time pressure, information overload and other environmental factors can increase the perceived complexity of a task." ((Pollay, 1970; Einhorn, 1971; Janis, 1972; Wright, 1974; Koriat et al., 1980; Payne, 1982; Pitz & Sachs, 1984; Yates, 1990; Maule & Edland, 1997; Ordonez & Benson, 1997). The complexity bias is one dependent on environmental factors, specifically the stress associated with those factors. It states that there are numerous factors such as time pressure, information overload, or even general comfort that can negatively influence a decision's quality. There is even a mathematical approach to this bias: the Yerkes-Dodson law, which states that less stress equates to lower decision quality, yet more stress also results in low decision quality. It is only within the perfect balance of stress (enough to make the decision seem important, but not enough to cause anxiety), that decisions can best be made. In my ISP, I think that there are factors that would have caused high stress, though some are out of my control. An example of which is SOME of my peers' questionable work ethic, where they have put off deciding on an ISP to work on and thus, are scrambling (high stress) at the last minute to pick one. Another factor would be the extensive amount of information through research and careful planning that I included in my ISP's business proposal. This increase in stress could have been mitigated on my part by creating a more concise, clear business proposal. However, I wanted to carefully plan each step as I intended that those interested in my ISP would take the time to read over each element for complete clarity. I plan to overcome the obstacle of the complexity bias by ensuring a complete understanding of my ISP's logistics by each team member, as the bias itself implies that one would join without full knowledge of the plan.</p>

     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">3. CONFIRMATION</p>
     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">"Often decision makers seek confirmatory evidence and exclude search for disconfirming information." (Cyert, Dill & March, 1958; Simon, 1958; Wason, 1960; Einhorn & Hogarth, 1978,1986; Fischhoff & Beyth-Maron, 1983; Hogarth, 1987; Evans, 1989; Bazerman, 1990; Russo, Medvec & Meloy, 1996, Heath, 1996). The confirmation bias harks on people's inherent nature to cherry pick true evidence in order to reduce anxiety in their minds about the quality of the decision they make. This can be extremely harmful, as it completely ignores "one of the foundations of scientific method: information that refutes a hypothesis is more valuable than information that supports the hypothesis". It is clear how this very bias could definitely be derived from my ISP's section containing pure, irrefutable data: the relevance section. In the relevance section, I included the results of a survey I conducted asking students' demographic, grade level, and lunch eating experience. I specifically highlighted many students' answers regarding their average  wait times in the school lunch lines as confirmatory proof that my business proposal was relevant and thus, worthy of being a "quality" decision. However, it would be plausible that my fellow peers could have chosen my business proposal based off of the seemingly definitive evidence: students at the high school have provided data to confidently assume that the lunch lines take a relatively long amount of time. Yet, based on the confirmation bias, this line of reasoning is inherently faulty as it means that those fallen into this bias did not conduct further research before joining my team. To overcome this, I will simply add a research stage to the ISP's work schedule in which we find a variety of evidence to be more knowledgeable about the situation and circumstances surrounding this project.</p>

     <br />

     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">4. CONJUNCTION</p>
     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">"Probability is often overestimated in compound conjunctive problems." (Chesnick & Harlan, 1972; Bar Hillel, 1973; Cohen, Tversky & Kahneman, 1974; Yates, 1990; Teigen, Martinussen & Lund, 1996; Bazerman, 1998). The conjunction bias is a bit trickier to understand than previous biases, as one must be familiar with the concept of compound conjunctive events. Conjunctive/compound events are elements of a process that conjoin to create a final product. Take the process of penning an essay, for example. The process of understanding the prompt, gathering evidence, and developing a line of reasoning throughout said essay are all compound conjunctive events that are required for completion. Now, the bias arises when people fail to rationalize this process; they overestimate, or oversimplify, the probability of conjunctive events. This bias could very well exist in  my ISP in terms of my GANTT chart, in which I include (in my own error) an oversimplified plan for my ISP's progress. (In my personal defense, I created it this way for the purpose of flexibility). However, the bias still has the potential to prevail, as the oversimplification of my business proposals' progress by possible teammates could have resulted in the faulty assumption of its completion date. To battle this threatening strife, I will personally advocate for timely work completion; I will have a near-zero tolerance for laziness and will strive to make sure my team is at maximum productivity whilst maintaining excellent workspace positivity.</p>

     <br />

     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">5. IMAGINABILITY</p>
     <p class="chapter-text intro-text">"An event will be judged more probable if it can be easily imagined." (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, Lichtenstein et al., 1978, Taylor & Thompson, 1982).The imaginability bias results from the human capabilities of imagination, specifically their ability to visualize completely new models. Likewise to some of the previous biases, the detrimental aspect of the bias is in people's tendency to underestimate the probability of errors or problems within a situation. This occurs when one is able to almost fully realize the extent of an event conceptually, which results in a false feeling of safety associated with the newly created familiarity that the person imagines. However, the imagination is in no way complete and devoid of error, thus the safety (lower estimation of the probability of failure) is also in no way absolute. This bias could be apparent in my ISP due to the scope of which my business proposal covers its goals/intentions. My business proposal followed a rubric to establish its purpose as such: indentity, problem, solution, target market, competition, revenue streams, marketing activities, expenses, team and key roles, milestones, and a GANTT chart. In addition, I also included statistical data from the students of the high shool to prove the relevance of the project. According to the imaginability bias, it would be extremely easy for one to conceptualize my ISP's plan in their heads and think it through, meaning that their percieved estimation of failure would be lower due to the created familiarity. I intend to combat this issue by developing even deeper into possible outcomes of the ISP with my teammates during meetings in order to achieve total realization of the circumstances and potentials surrounding my ISP.</p>
