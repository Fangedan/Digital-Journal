    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">The issue on the table: AI sentience and its potential (or lack of) to elicit a utopia for greater mankind or to bring forth fiction-like mass detriment to humans.</p>

    <br />
    
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">My stance on the subject matter is this:</p>
    <h4>By looking rearward at the pattern of our history itself and the positive patterns of permutations, I believe that sentient AI is not a matter of if, but when, and also that when said "beings" reach singularity, humans will have developed substantial safety protocols to effectively control all its actions.</h4>

    <br />

    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Firstly, I must explain why I believe that sentient AI is inevitable, that it most definitely will be a reality in an unknown future. My rationale is that history (or at least the positive aspects of it) repeats itself and that people are prone to underestimation of their own abilities. Though it has taken an excruciating amount of time, we, in our modern world, are abundant in strong evidence pointing to our exponentially increasing development in technology. Globally drastic developments include the invention of the wheel, the Neolithic Revolution (people discovered farming), the industrial revolution, advances in modern medicine and mainstream social meanings, all of which occur in shorter and shorter increments of time (a telltale sign of exponential growth). Furthermore, another pattern that shares a comparatively biological relationship to growth is our doubt. In the past, there were those who believed that flight was impossible; the airplane was invented. There were those who believed in the impossibility of a solar system; scientists diligently proved them wrong. And lastly, there is simply the possibility that we can create realities that we have never taken into consideration. A primitive caveman would have been marveled, even bewildered, at the medieval knights, their shiny armor, and astoundingly flamboyant castles in the late 15th centuries. Likewise, a knight from the middle ages would be starstruck if he ever laid eyes on our gen Z social media constructs (even I do not fully understand that phenomenon). So, why should we limit ourselves to speculate only the narrow lens of AI’s sentience? Our pondering could be expanded on to a massive extent, and maybe that curiosity lends itself into motivation and that is why (or how) things are created. However, that is merely speculation, or a philosophic theory (as time’s documents’ analytics insist on naming it).</p>

    <br />

    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Now, we approach the topic at hand - my claim on the effects of sentient AI; that it (though extremely strict sounding) CAN and WILL be under total control from humans. Again, my rationale for this belief derives from a reflection of our history. As mentioned earlier, innovation occurred at a fast pace, as it is our human nature to grow, to learn, to invent. Thus, it is only logical to conclude that since we have been able to safely contain all of these previous experiments, it would be the same for not only AI, but any other technology we create in the future.</p>

    <br />

    <h4>Except that would be false</h4>

    <br />

    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Lies, lies, lies, or so we would like to call it. Unsuccessful attempts by historians to hide shameful stumbles by inventors ultimately highlight the cause for concern for society’s collective safety when sentient AI knocks at the doors of reality. Examples of detrimental (yet more importantly, unbeknownst to people, including the pioneers) experiments include the invention of lead and discovery of X-rays (and its radiation). Moreover, is it a certainty that we can assure that sentient AI will not fall into the wrong hands? The evidence I would like to bring up to support this superstition are weapons (obviously, some are put in the hands of those with deceitful intent).</p>

    <br />

    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Finally, I will bring up another point; how are we to know that sentient AI does not already exist, that its intelligence is advanced enough that it is simply hiding under our radars, growing in power, waiting for a time in the future to attack? Ultimately, sentient AI’s effect on mankind would depend on its intent, which is, of course, simply hypothetical at the moment.</p>
