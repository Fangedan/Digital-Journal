	    </div>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>(Software) Development Engineer: This role specializes in the back-end of our project, primarily focusing on creating a functional app and ordering system for the team. They will use their knowledge of program construction to design, develop, test, and maintain the software required for the app. In addition, they may continue work to optimize software for speed and scalability and also potentially consult with stakeholders and internal customers about the project. As I feel confident in my wide (yet limited) knowledge in computer science, I believe that I would be well suited to take on this role. However, I understand that challenges might appear, such as actually creating functional software, debugging, and creating a user interface. I plan on combating these issues through sheer work, dedication, and time investments, yet I will also inquire with my teammates and others willing to help.</p>
	      <p>QA Engineer: A quality assurance engineer is essentially one that monitors the range, or scope, of the software. They will oversee every phase of the software development process, including design, development, testing, debugging, and delivery. They will make sure that every one of these stages is polished to complete perfection, that nothing is left unchecked and thus, must require a great level of attention to detail. They will work with every member of the team, serving as adhesive glue to stick every component together so that the project is successful. I believe that I posses an attention to detail adequate enough for this role, and I firmly trust in my communication of line of development skills needed to bring everything together. However, it is possible that work blocks may appear, where no member of the team is able to brainstorm an idea just yet. I plan on overcoming these seemingly hopeless times by employing excellent leadership: turning to focus on what people can progress in rather than being stuck.</p>
	      <p>Project Manager: This role is extremely similar to the quality assurance engineer, except they have the widest scope, surrounding the entire project's production process in all parts: the whole. They are responsible for setting the goals of the project, keeping team members on schedule, managing the project's cost, budget, and resources, communicating with stakeholders, assessing risks, troubleshooting, and ultimately, to make the project a success all the way until closure. It requires the same, if not more, intense level of attention to detail as the QA Engineer, and thus is oftentimes much more responsible and commanding. I feel like this role is the "top dog", or highest ranking in leadership of the team, and I am comfortable taking on that role if I needed to. Difficulties would be obvious to this type of role, as it contains the most resposibility and therefore the most pressure, specifically in regards to time management. Luckily, I believe that I have excelled in my time management skills and actually am eager to aid others in achieving their goals in a timely manner.</p>
	      <p>Product Manager: The product manager is unlike the past roles, as they are focused on the on-field aspects of the projects, sepcifically all of its relations to consumer demands, business objectives, and larger external visions. This role hones in on user experience, catering pretty much all their efforts into the customers, the people using the app. They accomplish this by being on the "field": having direct interaction with those the product is intended for prior to, during, and before its release, providing valueable information and feedback to the team so they are better able to serve. My personal suitability for this role is extremely high: I have numerous connections to those who eat school lunches (who the application is serving) and I also eat school lunch every day. Furthermore, I usually do not have a huge problem approaching new people, especially if I were just surveying them about their school lunch experience. However, this role would require a great deal of soft social skills and could potentially be extremely draining. I plan on warding off these dry spells of a lack of energy through effective goal setting, self-accountability, and team-accountability.</p>
	      <p>Release Engineer: The release engineer serves most similarly to a scribe for the team project's source code, ensuring its proper documentation, implementatino into software or programs, and deployment. They are largely responsible for the development, audit, accountability, and delivery of various software components on time. Working with all other members of the team, especially the quality assurance engineer, they should be able to distinguish all required components for product releases and constantly research the advantages and consequences of modern software engineering techniques and their implications for the software cycle. Overall, this role requires the most intensive, raw "computer science" coding skills as they are totally focused on software. I believe I posses a great deal of both organization as well as general coding knowledge to be suitable for this role. However, like every computer scientist, they will run into code errors, debugging, and potentially lose source code. I plan on mitigating these risks by keeping tight, unforgiving control over my documentation and hold myself to the highest responsibility possible.</p>
