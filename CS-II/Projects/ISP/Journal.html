	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week, my main technical challenges were primarily contained in Visual Studio Code, which is the software application we are using to create the backend aspect of our application. After executing the initial git pull and such from our GitHub repository under 2023 ISP's, I was able to successfully and reliably pull the source code (in its latest version) at any time, as well as commit and push it back at any time. An insignificant issue I encountered was exiting the text editor in Visual Studio Code; I initially believed the editor was Emacs, so I could simply Ctrl-X Ctrl-C out, but then I realized that it was actually Windows/VI Git Bash, so the correct command to exit was to first enter insert mode with Ctrl-I, and then exit with :wq. Luckily, I have had previous experience in previous out of school computer science classes. However, the main issue I faced this week was as such: 4/6/2023 (Andrew Lin): I am currently searching through the entirety of all the files we have so far on the app, yet I cannot seem to find the reason why whenever I type "npm start" and scan the QR code on my IOS device, it successfully "runs" yet on my phone nothing happens. I have tried several variations of running the app, yet I cannot seem to achieve the run as seen in our Webex Spaces groupchat; every instance my phone immediately shuts down ExpoGo, so I am reasonably confused. My educated guess is that the code we have so far is tailored, even excusively, I might confer, for only Android devices as I have a few reasons why I would belive so: The QR code we utilize to run the app, though IOS Camera App friendly, nontheless takes you to the ExpoGo application, which as I mentioned before immediately aborts after completing the build. Even though it recognizes that I am using an IOS device, it still primarily runs suited towards Android devices: "iOS Running app on Android". Another error I got was the following (whilst utilizing an iOS device): "No Android connected device found, and no emulators could be started automatically." As this message states, it would require my to further download another emulator onto my iOS device to run, which is a relatively large problem. These were my findings for definite bugs and problems of importance that we must fix.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: This week, I was generally able to focus on the task on hand and thus had little to no scheduling problems. The issues surrounding Visual Studio did indeed take a sizeable portion of time to debug, yet I was able to manage it in due time.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: As I was primarily solo coding on Visual Studio Code the past week, I have had relatively little time to check up on my teammates' work. However, in the moments we had I am able to deduce that we are all getting tasks accomplished to a reasonable extent. A fun little snippet: we managed to find the time to have a group "tournament" (though all in good spirits) of chess where we were able to simply bond not only as teammates, but more importantly as friends.</p>
	      <p>Significant Achievement: As mentioned in the technical challenges, I encountered a massive bug of Android exclusitivity whilst coding, and thus published my findings to a problems.txt file we had just for that type of situation. The link to said file's commit can be found here:</p>

              <p>Technical Challenges: This week, I was notified of the finite time our team has left to complete the ISP. So, accounting for our variables of time and work production rate, I made the executive decision to modify our MVP that we are trying to get out in order to make it a little easier for the team. I discussed this and notified all the team members about this decision: As the deadline for The Caf√© Project approaches, I would like to have a final clarification for our expected MVP for the final. I believe that the plan proposed below will be the most realistic for us to achieve whilst maintaining every core aspect of our original app idea:
		Cafeteria administrator login / OR / [Start Ordering] button (The very first page of the app will prompt the user to either login as a cafeteria staff worker to view pending orders or to start ordering if it is a student looking to order lunch)
		Student (in the case if the user is a student):
		Order start screen (no sign in required, the first page will simply prompt the student to type in their ID number and name) (we have made more than this already, yet for the sake of the simplicity of requirements below I believe it would be best if there was no sign in and instead students providing information)	      
		The Roost menu, as well as adding entrees (this I see we have already made progress on with the Chicken Sandwich, price, and ability to select the amount to add to a cart)
		View/Modify cart (students should be able to click on a cart icon to view/remove items from cart) (these items are from what the student orders immediately beforehand and the page should also simply display the student's ID number and name as inputted before so the cafeteria workers can verify their identity and order once the student shows up to the restaurant)
		Cafeteria Worker (in the case if the user is a cafeteria worker):	      
Page displaying all pending orders (from student orders) (separated list should include student ID, name, and items ordered) (near each order the worker should have the ability to either delete or complete the order, both of those buttons simply remove the order from the app)</p>
              <p>Scheduling Challenges: Now, with the modified MVP I believe that our team should be able to easily follow along with the GANTT Chart to complete it before our deadline at the end of the School Year. A major problem our members had was managing their time as coursework and the courseload began to bear a large burden on them. I believe I was lenient by modifying the MVP so that they would have an easier time completing the MVP.</p>        
              <p>Interpersonal Challenges: I would not consider this a personal challenge, rather a collective obstacle that our group had to overcome, which was that our coursework was hindering our ability to spend plentiful amounts of time on The Cafe Project's app. Thus, we all collectively agreed to modify the GANTT Chart and MVP final plan to cater our time needs. Thankfully, this was all taken with large tokens of appreciation and gratefulness.</p>
	      <p>Significant Achievement: My significant achievement was listening to the team member's requests and acting upon them with an executive decision to make the load of each portion of the MVP lighter by modifying it and the GANTT Chart.

              <p>Technical Challenges: This week, we began the creation element of our application, primarily utilizing the React Native App for Andriod and iOS. React Native allows us to create simple applications for both Andriod and iOS devices simutaneously so everyone (most people with a modern phone) can access the app with their phone. I collaborated with all members of my team to ensure the process of creating the login screen went smoothly, and it was rough but overall, a success. First, we began the project setup where we learned about React Native and familiarized ourselves with its features and UI. Next, we setup the basic login screen, added text input for username and password, added buttons to log in, and simple styling as well to make it aesthetically pleasing. One technical hitch that troubled us (though we were able to overcome it fairly easily) was the seperation of buttons as when we began to implement more than one button they all stuck together. However, we were able to create a successful login screen that we tested and ran by the QA.</p>    
              <p>Scheduling Challenges: The entire process of familiarization, creating, debugging, and testing of the application was extremely time extensive. It was an entire team effort as we were all basically scrambling against time to produce a real login screen. However, through careful time management during class we successfully created the login screen and were ready to move onto the next step of the lunch menu.</p>
              <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Though our QA and one of the software engineers exhibited some minor forms of laziness, we nontheless completed the assignment for the weekto an acceptable extent. I am thankful for a group that can put themselves to the grind and work until the mission (login screen) is completed.</p>
	      <p>Significant Achievement: As mentioned above, I collaborated with the entire team to assure smooth production of the week's process of a login screen. The github link to the finished issue can be found here:</p>

              <p>Technical Challenges: This week, we encountered a major roadblock in our ISP's development, primarily arising from the payPams section, as stated in the Cafeteria Manager's reply to our previous proposal email. The problem was that payPams was not willing to work with a third party company to collaborate. So, my team and I got to thinking and scripted a modified project plan and sent it as an email to the Student Nutrition Manager/Director: Hello Mrs. Reitzammer,
Thank you for your response. Our team has discussed the issues presented in your email and have come up with an adaptation of our original proposal.
The modified pre-ordering app would be completely separate from any monetary aspects of the student ordering experience. We would simply provide a method for students to create an "order" on the app as usual (adding any mix of items they would like, as well as the time they estimate they will arrive at the restaurant), then the cafeteria staff would only have to look at the student's order and prepare it beforehand. Once the student arrives, the cafeteria workers simply scan the QR code provided by the app on the student's phone to verify the identity/order, and then the students would scan their ID's as usual to pay for the item(s), thus allowing our application to speed up the ordering process while staying out of the payment realm.
Due to the nature of the modified version of our proposal, we would no longer need to affiliate with any payment:all we now need is contact with the cafeteria workers to instruct them on the simple tasks of scanning QR codes and checking any orders. We believe that in accordance with the issues proposed in your previous email, this new plan is much more viable and should be easier for the staff and ourselves. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email us. Thank you for your time, waiting to hear your response.

              <p>Scheduling Challenges: The scheduling challenge for this week was responding to the Cafeteria Manager's email in a timely manner, which was overcome as we succesfully utilized our time in class to discuss the email, as well as the modified project plan to discontinue the payPams aspect.</p>     
              <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Thankfully, though we all had differing opinions, rationales, and solutions to the payPams problem, our entire team was able to have civilized and thoughtful discussion about how to proceed with our application development. Yet again, I am extremely thankful for our team's ability to collaborate and accomplish problems together.</p>
              <p>Significant Achievement: The significant achievement I made this week was to act as the Project Manager by bringing the team together, leading the discussion about how to proceed, and finally, scripting the modified project plan email to send to the Student Nutrition Manager/Director.

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week, the buzz around class was at an all time high as everyone was gearing up for the upcoming Spring Break. In regards to ISP work, our team collectively agreed to put in, in the very least, a reasonable single (1) contribution to the project. Now, being the Project Manager, I felt it was my obligation to help my teammates brainstorm anything they could manage over the break. So, I collaborated with each of my team members to help plan their Spring Break. In addition, I have also updated and solidified our project's GANTT Chart, which can be found here: https://sharing.clickup.com/45028730/g/h/1ay5bu-1030/f761ef6bbcbf130 The basic run-down of The Cafe Project's schedule is as such: Phase 1: Research, Planning, and Team Building from 10/3/2022-2/28/2023, Phase 2: Design from 3/1/2023-3/31/2023, Phase 3: Development from 4/1/2023-4/14/2023, Phase 4: Testing & Revision from 4/15/2023-4/30/2023, Phase 5: Deployment from 5/1/2023-5/31/2023.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: As this week's primary assignment for me was to solidify the GANTT Chart for the team so they know deadlines for the project, I was able to complete it to a successful degree. I completed the chart on the Thursday of the week, thus giving adequate time for my teammates to set up the plan according to their Spring Break schedule. Furthermore, as I have already collaborated with my team members during the GANTT Chart creation process, it was exceptionally easy for them to accomplish their assigned task for the Spring Break.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: By now, it should be obvious what I have to say about my teammates, though I suppose anything is susceptible to change, whether good or bad, so I will restate: my teammates are an amazing bunch to work with, on all occasions I find little to no problems working with them and I could not have been blessed with a better group.</p>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week, my team and I faced the task of communicating with the Cafeteria Managers as a result of us looking forward into our project. We realized that in order to implement our system including connectivity with payPams, we would need to first gain approval from the Allen High School Cafeteria staff and administrators. Thus, we collectively scribed an email which I sent out: Hello Mrs. Oujout,	      
		This is Andrew Lin, representative for The Cafe Project team. We are a group of computer scientists who have developed an app proposal as a school project for our class. We have decided on an application that students of Allen High School may use to pre-order lunch and pick up the pre-made meal through the app in order to reduce lunch line times.
		The purpose of this email is to ask for permission to work with the financial manager (manager for AISD's PayPams information) so that we can link the student's PayPams account to our app. Furthermore, we would also like to receive the contact information (or direct information if you have it) of the lunch supply manager for The Roost restaurant, as that is where we plan on beginning the project. This is for two reasons:
		1. We will be able to cooperate with The Roost to receive, update, and implement a way of storing/managing the restaurant's supply and price of food, which can be seen by the student's in their ordering process.
		2. Our team will be able to personally meet with the staff at The Roost once we have completed the app so that we may be able to instruct them on the technicalities, functions, and roles the app requires of them. This will hopefully eventually create an essentially perfectly self-sustainable team/usage of the app for the future.
		If you would like more information about The Cafe Project, please look into our business proposal:
		https://codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html
		In addition, we have a splendid little poster made by our team to advertise the production stages of our app (please see file attached below).
		If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please email us.
		Thank you for your time, waiting to hear your response.
- Andrew Lin</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: As the entirety of the week's work time for the ISP was spent on the perfection and persuasive element of the email, I didn't have many other scheduling challenges as I already sent the plan to my teammates and it was up to them to continue progress on the software and UI of the application.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Once more, I cannot stress how satisfying it is to work with my beloved team. I genuinely believe that our thoughrough collaboration on the email sent to the Cafeteria Manager will be sufficient to cover the vast majority of all aspects surrounding The Cafe Project's app's application to the lunch lines.</p>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week, we were assigned with the task of creating a minimum viable product for the Cafe Project's app. It was time consuming, yet forced us to think about the technicalities of the app and how it was going to function. I'd say the most important part of the process was realizaing the limitations to our product: we dreamed to big of a dream so it is now come to our attention that it would be much more viable if we started the scope only within the Pizza Hut or subway of Allen High School. This would remove a large number of technical challenges, such as coordinating an evolving menu (Pizza Hut's menu never changes), the previoulsy excessively complicated UI (only restaurant to pre-order from is now pizza hut), and payment (pay as soon as you order, this allows us to consolidate all online orders into a third line at the Pizza Hut, therby reducing line times). In addition, while presenting we were also made aware of some limitations, which we have brainstormed solutions to: if someone orders and pays for a pizza and when they arrive the stock is empty, they can use the QR code provided to recieve a refund. Because of these new insights and the lowering of scope for our ISP, we should be able to create the minimum viable product and ensure its sucess upon deployment.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: Interestingly enough, the ice week from two weeks prior is still influencing many classes at the high school through its disruptive time taken off. This week has been arguably more stressful than the level of last week, as there are still a large load of assignments and major grades that are ocurring. However, my ISP team has managed to complete not only the mvp, (which we all, for the most part, worked dilligently on) but also was able to create a rough draft for the advertisement, as well as completion of this week's Lindenmayer Merlin mission. Overall, I am very proud of my team for the work they have put in this week to achieve desired results.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Although the team did display a hint of procrastination regarding the mvp, we still completed it by the time it was due and assured that it was of quality. Furthermore, I am impressed by my teammates' ability to think on their feet, which was displayed prominently during the mvp presentation, where we were essentially grilled numerous questions, all mostly answered by the team. I believe that the team will be able to follow our schedule to complete the minimum Cafe Project app by the deadline.</p>

            <div class="w3-container">
	      
              <p>Technical Challenges: This week, our group essentially broke off into seperate sections and "grinded" on our individual tasks for The Cafe Project app. As the project manager, I dove into a state of brainstorming and inspiration this week. This was in large part due to this week's computer science topic: LSystems, or Lindenmayer Systems. This concept was intensely intriguing to me as one of my favorite parts about computer science is softwarre development: looking into actual code, brainstorming solutions, and of course, debugging. Oddly enough, for many of the .swift files that we have been using for computer science, I have never had a major problem with the debugging process, whether it be on my own code or someone I am trying to help. I feel like this is because I have an adequate understanding on what every assignment's purpose or goal is, at least in the context of an Allen High School computer science class. For instance, I followed along with the conceptuality of Merge Sort (a sort we studied in class) fairly easily with my peers, but when implementing it in code I believe I had a strong understanding. Likewise, in this weeks' LSystem assignment, it only took me an hour or so to complete the entirety of Part 1. Furthermore, I had relatively few troubles in the entire process of creating the LSystem, as I felt I had not only understood it, but was immediately brainstorming ways to implement it onto swift. Of course, the fact that I have worked intensively with classes and Igis before in last year's CS-1 course massively aided me, but I still found a certain thrill in the speed of my completion of the system. The system itself is fairly simple and can be defined as a program that utilizes a certain set of rules, alphabet, and axiom to iterate (potentially infinitely) over generations of a starting string. This fascinatingly leads to somewhat complex patterns found in nature, especially plants. Most importantly, I gained an inspiration from this project to potentially implement in my team's ISP app through fun little features such as one's restaurant visiting, or meal order schedule based off of a LSystem.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: As mentioned in last week's journal, last week we only attended school on Monday, which set every single class back a week. As my physics teacher stated: "...with that comes danger as the deadlines don't move back, instead, they continue to come closer" (Sawyers 2023). As a result, this week it is so unfortunate, but desireably neccessary, that seven out of my eight classes had at least one major grade assigned. I will list them in order of period: (1. Physics) (2. Choir) (3. Theater) (4. English) (5. Computer Science) (6. Encore - no assignment thankfully) (7. PreCalculus) (8. U.S. History). However, I have displayed extreme time management skills in order to complete these assignments: I have dilligently been staying up until around 1:30AM working on these assignments without distraction: my average screen time on my phone has went down by a factor of 3 (I am spending roughly only 1.5 hours on my phone everyday, mainly for work reasons but 15 minutes can be attributed to listening to music as I workout). As I am writing this I have completed four out of the seven assignments. I have hope that I will be able to persevere and be successful in my educational pursuits.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: This week I had extremely limited time with my team members, however, the time we did spend in class together conversing about ISP related topics went well. In particular, I was able to explain the majority of my code that I made for this week's Lindenmayer System to my teammates and I believe they fully understood my intent and reasons for the code. Again, I just wanted to state that my team is a lovely bunch that ultimately does bring joy to me, even in times of consolidation and work.</p>

	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week was our team's design process surrounding our ISP's user interface. One of our major discussion points was whether or not to implement the Cafe Project as a website or an app. We decided against the former as students would have to inconveniently find the link or search it up everytime they wanted to order, which would slightly defeat the purpose of convenience for our app. With an app, we deducted that student's could not only be able to access it with a tap on their phone but that they would also be able to reliably store sensitive data in the app itself, such as payment info, login username and passwords. So, with confidence and a goal of convenience and accessability in mind, we began designing the user interface for the app, starting with the login screen, where we would prompt the user to either sign up or login, as many apps do. Once signed in, the user will be prompted to connect their account to a paypams account registered with the school, so that payment is similar to scanning your ID to pay (as regular students do for lunch). We are currently working on the other neccecary features regarding the ordering process so that the app may be fully functional. However, I do not forsee any major problems so far so I am confident in our team's progress.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: This week was by far the most schedule-intense week due to the Allen High School Shrek musical, which I am a member of. As this was our opening week, I spent a large portion of my time (4:30PM-10:00PM from Mon-Thur, and 7:00AM-11:00PM on Friday and Saturday) at after school rehearsals and performances. Luckily, through an insane level of hard work and committment, I was able to pull through the week and complete all of my assignments, including work on the ISP (which was some updates on our GANTT chart).</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Although it could be claimed that we were all a little drowsy and worn, I would still find the joy in working with such an intelligent group. This was demonstrated through our numerous conversations regarding the user interface of our ISP's app. I could keep up with the conversation, as well as add insightful commentary, and what really suprised me is that every single member was able to do the same; no matter which turn we took in the decision making, somebody always had a good idea that caught on and attributed to our success with the user interface design. Yet again, my team provides a level of security to me as I am fully confident in their decision making and brainstorming ability so I have loosened their reigns, so to speak, and given them more freedom in not only the intricate details, but also as to how our team will continue to design, implement, and test our ISP's app.</p>

	    </div>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>Technical Challenges: This week, our main focus in regards to the ISP was to install Visual Studio Code and Node.js. Personally, I had very few troubles installing them, the biggest setback being procrastination. Thanks to one of our lovely team member's crystal clear instructions in an issue, I was able to simply click, read, and have both applications downloaded on both my personal and school computer. It was quite honestly one of the smoothest downloads I have underwent. Once I downloaded Visual Studio Code, I went through the process of creating a new file with the suffix ".js" so we can write in javascript (this is so that later, it will be easy to upload the application on both IOS and Andriod). Afterwards, I went into the settings and did very minor personalization changes in regards to the system's UI. What was arguably even easier was downloading Node.js: here are the exact steps as in our Github issues: "install Node.js through this link https://nodejs.org/en/ . Install the one that says recommended, not the one that says latest features". I did not even have to login, much less interact with the application. I simply needed it downloaded.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: Scheduling challenges were by far the most stressful this week, as we had the extremely daunting task of learning about a completely new subject: SQL. In that week alone, I spent a certain 5+ hours simply taking handwritten notes on W3Schools about the subject. Thus, I was extremely familiar with the material we went over in class. However, primarily due to needless chatter and small internet issues, we seemingly covered less material than what I had written in my notes. This was both a blessing and a curse; I was now knowledgable about the subject to a comfortable extent, but I could have spent less time taking notes. The time could have been spent working on our ISP, something that minimal time was put into. Furthermore, I spend a total of 18 hours a week at my high school's musical rehearsal: Shrek. The combination of schoolwork, homework, rehearsals, and self relaxation time was definetely tested this week. However, I feel like I made adequate progress in all these areas of my life and hope to continue to keep up the hard work.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Words can hardly express how grateful I am for my team members. Expectedly, it was a great pleasure to collaborate with every member, though we had limited time together. Overall, I would say I had no interpersonal challenges with any team member.</p>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>Technical Challenges: By far, the single most painstakingly consuming challenge that the team faced was figuring out how to utilize each part of github to plan and document the ISP. In terms of the week's canvas assignment, which was just primarily editing the README.md file and create issues, I struggled a needlesly large amount. Now, I was already extremely familiar with the interactions between Github and the shell/terminal: I had worked with both intensively during my CS-1 ISP. I had already created a directory specifically for the ISP's repository and initial files, and I had even edited the files to include what was required in the assigment. However, though I attempted countless times to push those files onto the repository, I was always unsuccessful. This saddened me. However, the next day in class I discovered that these failures were due to the fact that I was not officially part of the project yet and thus I had no permissions to push those files. It is fixed now, and once I was given permissions I quickly recognized the steps to pull, edit, add, commit, and push files into the repository. From then on (in regards to the README.md file), it was smooth sailing: I was able to create an issue for myself and my teammates to actually complete the assignments, as well as including a vividly detailed set of instructions for doing so:

		1. Go to your shell (guacamole/terminal/tabby)
	      
		2. cd (to get to home directory)
	      
		3. create directory, mine is titled TheCafeProject
	      
		4. go to the "<>code" section of this repository and press the green button labeled "<>code, then copy the https link
	      
		5. in shell, go to your newly created directory and do:
	      
		6. git init
	      
		7. git remote add origin [insert https link]
	      
		8. git pull [insert https link]
	      
		9. emacs README.md
	      
		10. edit file as per instructions in the comment above
	      
		11. [ctrl + x] [ctrl + s] (saves file)
	      
		12. [ctrl + x] [ctrl + c] (exits file)
	      
		13. git add README.md
	      
		14. git commit README.md -m "add personal information to README.md file"
	      
		15. git push --set-upstream origin master
	      
		16. login (make sure you know your github username and password/key)
	      
		17. go to https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-CafeProject go to branch: master
	      
		18. click on "1 commit ahead"
	      
		19. keep pressing green buttons (trust) (first one says something along the lines of new pull request)
	      
		    20. check here: https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-CafeProject

	      I was pleased that I was able to help my teammates out in completing this step, as well as completing a few steps such as "writing a meaningful comment" myself. Other than that, we put our remaining focus into creating issues to start work on the ISP, beginning with the layout of our login/home page of the application.</p>
	      <p>Scheduling Challenges: For our team, scheduling challengers were minor: though we finnished just in time, it was an adequate amount of time and we completed our assignment to a quality level. From a purely logistical standpoint, we actually had no challenges in terms of scheduling for the amll range of the week, yet for our entire project as a whole... it is not so well. Though I am confident we will succeed in creating a great project, it is recognized that we do not have a master schedule detailing our every step. However, with hard work and perseverence I believe we will be able to create a working product.</p>
	      <p>Interpersonal Challenges: Overall, I felt that our team worked in such cordial unison; I loved every second of working with them, working through problems, successes, and failures. We essentially had the majority of our project done by the time the week was halfway over. By the help of extremely effective communications and a general friendly, positive workspace environment, we were able to complete our tasks with minimal stress. The only challenges I can think of are being able to physically - face to face - talk with my teammates all at the same time easily. This problem arises primarily due to our seating arrangement, as we are in a relatively spaced out line. However, this problem is extremely minimal as I could just announce important information twice and that would suffice for the whole group. Other than that, I am wholly pleased with my group's ability to cooperate and problem solve utilizing critical thinking.</p>

	      <h5>Title description: <span class="w3-opacity">Team Roles</span></h5>
	    </div>

	    <div class="w3-container">
	      <p>(Software) Development Engineer: This role specializes in the back-end of our project, primarily focusing on creating a functional app and ordering system for the team. They will use their knowledge of program construction to design, develop, test, and maintain the software required for the app. In addition, they may continue work to optimize software for speed and scalability and also potentially consult with stakeholders and internal customers about the project. As I feel confident in my wide (yet limited) knowledge in computer science, I believe that I would be well suited to take on this role. However, I understand that challenges might appear, such as actually creating functional software, debugging, and creating a user interface. I plan on combating these issues through sheer work, dedication, and time investments, yet I will also inquire with my teammates and others willing to help.</p>
	      <p>QA Engineer: A quality assurance engineer is essentially one that monitors the range, or scope, of the software. They will oversee every phase of the software development process, including design, development, testing, debugging, and delivery. They will make sure that every one of these stages is polished to complete perfection, that nothing is left unchecked and thus, must require a great level of attention to detail. They will work with every member of the team, serving as adhesive glue to stick every component together so that the project is successful. I believe that I posses an attention to detail adequate enough for this role, and I firmly trust in my communication of line of development skills needed to bring everything together. However, it is possible that work blocks may appear, where no member of the team is able to brainstorm an idea just yet. I plan on overcoming these seemingly hopeless times by employing excellent leadership: turning to focus on what people can progress in rather than being stuck.</p>
	      <p>Project Manager: This role is extremely similar to the quality assurance engineer, except they have the widest scope, surrounding the entire project's production process in all parts: the whole. They are responsible for setting the goals of the project, keeping team members on schedule, managing the project's cost, budget, and resources, communicating with stakeholders, assessing risks, troubleshooting, and ultimately, to make the project a success all the way until closure. It requires the same, if not more, intense level of attention to detail as the QA Engineer, and thus is oftentimes much more responsible and commanding. I feel like this role is the "top dog", or highest ranking in leadership of the team, and I am comfortable taking on that role if I needed to. Difficulties would be obvious to this type of role, as it contains the most resposibility and therefore the most pressure, specifically in regards to time management. Luckily, I believe that I have excelled in my time management skills and actually am eager to aid others in achieving their goals in a timely manner.</p>
	      <p>Product Manager: The product manager is unlike the past roles, as they are focused on the on-field aspects of the projects, sepcifically all of its relations to consumer demands, business objectives, and larger external visions. This role hones in on user experience, catering pretty much all their efforts into the customers, the people using the app. They accomplish this by being on the "field": having direct interaction with those the product is intended for prior to, during, and before its release, providing valueable information and feedback to the team so they are better able to serve. My personal suitability for this role is extremely high: I have numerous connections to those who eat school lunches (who the application is serving) and I also eat school lunch every day. Furthermore, I usually do not have a huge problem approaching new people, especially if I were just surveying them about their school lunch experience. However, this role would require a great deal of soft social skills and could potentially be extremely draining. I plan on warding off these dry spells of a lack of energy through effective goal setting, self-accountability, and team-accountability.</p>
	      <p>Release Engineer: The release engineer serves most similarly to a scribe for the team project's source code, ensuring its proper documentation, implementatino into software or programs, and deployment. They are largely responsible for the development, audit, accountability, and delivery of various software components on time. Working with all other members of the team, especially the quality assurance engineer, they should be able to distinguish all required components for product releases and constantly research the advantages and consequences of modern software engineering techniques and their implications for the software cycle. Overall, this role requires the most intensive, raw "computer science" coding skills as they are totally focused on software. I believe I posses a great deal of both organization as well as general coding knowledge to be suitable for this role. However, like every computer scientist, they will run into code errors, debugging, and potentially lose source code. I plan on mitigating these risks by keeping tight, unforgiving control over my documentation and hold myself to the highest responsibility possible.</p>
