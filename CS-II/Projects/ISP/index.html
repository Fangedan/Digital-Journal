    <h1>Description of ISP</h1>

    <br />

    <h3>The Cafe Project will be as follows: it aims to develop a technology-based system/app in which students can pre-order lunches securely, then pick up their desired food at the location which they select. This way, lunch lines would move much faster: only identity would need to be provided at the physical location, then food would be almost instantly received. The target market will primarily be for high school students with a personal device and ability to connect to the internet wishing to speed up their wait time in the school lunches. In the app/system, ordering a school lunch would allow you to choose where and what lunch you would like to pick up. We would allow the student to pay as soon as they order, with an extra added fee of around $0.25 for each order, almost negligible to the majority of the student population. (Note: keeping in mind those who are on the Free/Reduced lunch program, we would attain that information when the student logs in to the app, and thus be able to provide free lunch with limited choices.) The only expense would be the minimal amount of extra labor required to package orders together at a lunch location. However, our team could use that labor in a joint effort with the school's culinary arts program to provide both a job for students, as well as the service mentioned. Emails, newsletters, posters, and school announcements encouraging students to download the app would be prelavent throughout the school. In addition, the first few students to utilize the system are expected to have a positive experience, thus dispersing the news/effectiveness/ease/relief to other peers.</h3>
