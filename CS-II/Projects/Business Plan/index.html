    <p>The Cafe Project ultimately aims to aid in school cafeteria's extensive lunch line problems.</p>
    <p>Although there are some students that source their mid-day meal from out of school sources, the majority of students seek nutrition from their school's cafeterias. However, as schools grow their student body/population, lunch lines develop increasingly longer wait times; some extremes completely negate the student's ability to receive a lunch.</p>
    <p>Our solution is to develop a technology-based system/app in which students can pre-order lunches securely, then pick up their desired food at the location which they select. This way, lunch lines would move much faster: only identity would need to be provided at the physical location, then food would be almost instantly received.</p>

    <div id="Effectiveness" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5>Target Market</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The target market will primarily be for high school students with a personal device and ability to connect to the internet wishing to speed up their wait time in the school lunches.</p><br>
    
      <h5>The Competition</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">After a thourough examination, our team concluded that there were around 2 schools in upstate New York implementing a system similar to ours, however to a lesser extent. If our program succeeds, it would far outweigh the effectiveness of other school's lunch ordering system.</p><br>
    
    </div>

    <div id="Economy" class="w3-container menu w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5>Revenue Streams</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">In the app/system, ordering a school lunch would allow you to choose where and what lunch you would like to pick up. We would allow the student to pay as soon as they order, with an extra added fee of around $0.25 for each order, almost negligible to the majority of the student population. (Note: keeping in mind those who are on the Free/Reduced lunch program, we would attain that information when the student logs in to the app, and thus be able to provide free lunch with limited choices.)</p><br>
    
      <h5>Expenses</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">The only expense would be the minimal amount of extra labor required to package orders together at a lunch location. However, our team could use that labor in a joint effort with the school's culinary arts program to provide both a job for students, as well as the service mentioned.</p><br>

      <h5>Marketing Activities</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Emails, newsletters, posters, and school announcements encouraging students to download the app would be prelavent throughout the school. In addition, the first few students to utilize the system are expected to have a positive experience, thus dispersing the news/effectiveness/ease/relief to other peers.</p><br>

    <p><span class="w3-tag">Team and Key Roles</span> Currently, the only team member is the owner, Andrew Lin. As profits increase, The Cafe Project will look to employ additional members to support with bug fixes, represent, and most importantly, seek more schools to implement the system.</p>

    <p><span class="w3-tag">Milestones</span> The patient zero school we plan on launching in is: Allen High School. If we find success, we will plan on spreading to more school districts, dispensing a speedier lunch for all students across the globe.</p>

    <br />
    
    <p><span class="w3-tag">Relevance:</span> To gauge the relevance of this project, or if it is even applicable, I created a survey with numerous questions regarding students' demographic, grade level, and lunch eating experience. Below is a graph containing graphs about their average wait times in the school lunch lines.</p>
