   <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">1. Aidan-Valva Social Media Bot</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I considered this proposal because I thought there were defintely innovations that could be done in regards to social media. I saw the intended purpose, which was that it would allow for better consumer interaction and better connection to users, but I know applications such as these already exist. Furthermore, I had a problem with their revenue streams, which was using advertisments. I cannot say it is only overrated and overused (though it is), so I will call to attention the magnitude of time that would be wasted when employing such a revenue stream. Though this business proposal had good intentions, I decided to reject it for those reasons.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">2. Andrew-Eldridge Eavesdropping Detector</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I was extremely intruiged by this proposal as it seemed like it had an extremely well-rounded purpose and application. However, I thought about it for a mere minute and realized a fatal flaw: inapropriate usage of technology. I am not talking about simple games that could be played when not appropriate, but rather the danger of manipulative hacking / illegal computer use that would only be hidden more with the existence of this application. Though for personal security this could be benificial, such as passwords, credit card information, etc., the risk of taking advantage of this technology is too great and that is why I rejected this business proposal.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brayden-edington/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">3. Brayden-Edington RFID System</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">The security feature scanning students for a lack of an ID is a great idea, as it would improve the security of the school. However, there are numerous flaws with this idea. I still don't understand how they could insure that every person entering the school could be scanned. Furthermore, security guards would still be needed at every entrance to assist the technology in the case where an ID is not present. Lastly, if the ultimate aim were to replace security guards, where would the current security guards work? They would be rendered jobless, and could perform just as well or even better than the proposed business plan, which is why I rejected it.</p>

    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I saw this business proposal and initially believed it a solid idea. An online store that could offer its customers high-end gaming computers. However, its main flaw would have to be the competition. The ones listed (though many) are extremely prestigious already, competition that would be difficult to overcome. Furthermore, the numerous amounts of companies that already employ this type of technology (online shopping website) indicate that this business proposal is not that original, which is why I rejected it.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-fesseha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">5. Jacob-Fesseha Geese Studios</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I was interested in this concept for a video game company/studio. It is a great idea: simple geese themed video games that are designed just for downtime and pure enjoyment. I am by no means against such an idea, I think video games like these serve a valuable purpose in a society. However I decided to not opt into this business proposal because logically speaking, it is near impossible for a video game company founded by non-professional game developers that live their individual lives (high schoolers) to acheive high success. Because it is simply a dream rather than a reality, a decided to reject this business proposals ambitious plan</p>

       <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">6. Joshua-Lee Classroom Attendance with Facial Recognition</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">Again, improved security for school is of great intention and a worthy cause. The facial recognition is a sound idea where it would scan a student's face to check them in for attendance. However, I would argue that ways to check attendance that are more efficient, cheaper, and overall better already exist, such as the roll call that teachers have been doing for a long time. There is no guarantee that this system would be faster than your average teacher's roll call. Furthermore, there is also no guarantee that all students would remember to scan in, a responsibility that would be moved to the teacher if they did a roll call instead (plus, with a list of all students names, it would be harder to not call for a student). Because of these flaws, I have decided to reject this business proposal.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">7. Muqadam-Sabir Spaceward</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">This was an extremely humorous idea to me because of how it sounded too good to be true. Skyward that does not lag / without all the problems. Sounds like an upgrade improvement, but what would the majority of the time be spent doing once things have been fixed? I believe a better use of time would be another project rather than improving something that already exists. Furthermore, I barely have problems with my skyward (and I can speak for the majority of my friends too). The only area where I could see improvement is in arena scheduling where there is server lag due to the extreme use of the software, but that it mainly a hardware issue, not software. So, I have decided to reject this business proposal.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/nimrod-ohayon-rozanes/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">8. Nimrod-Ohayon-Rozanes ESC For Motorcycle</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I congradulate the proposal for its ambitious idea, yet I have a difficult time understanding the technology based side of this project as to my understanding, this is simply a speedometer accentuated by the logical fallacy of alphabet soup. "The ESC will be a firmware-swapped MCU, and will be responsible for the PID..." Fancy jargon or "shop talk" like this is a universally poor way to persuade someone. As stated before, the project relies on more of a mechanical standpoint, constructing a motorcycle, rather than any software based application. Because of its lacking concept, I have decided to reject this proposal.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">9. Tejasvi-Gutta Symptoms Quiz</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I immediately have a problem with this proposal: This could be extremely dangerous for healthcare if the system makes an error (something entirely possible if created by high school programmers) and causes a patient to be misdiagnosed, possibly worsening their condition or even cause death. As a society we already have professional doctors that could make a vastly better diagnosis on a patient's condition and reliably help cure them. Furthermore, if this dangerous application were to be implemented, doctors would be losing jobs, and as they are humans too that would need income to support themselves, this would be detrimental to many healthcare professions. For these reasons, I think that this proposal is very dangerous and thus, have decided to reject it.</p>

    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">10. Andrewm-Lin Cafe Project (ACCEPTED)</a>
    <p class="chapter-text intro-text">I have decided to accept this business proposal for numerous valid reasons such as its obtainability and relavence to the school. Not only is the website aesthetically pleasing (small thing), yet it also contains a well thought out plan, taking into account revenue, applications, logistics, and featuring data derived from the students of the school itself to prove its relavence. Personally speaking, I use the school lunch lines often so this would be beneficial if it were implemented, plus there would be numerous students that would also benefit from this software. Because of the obvious effort and passion put into this proposal, I have ultimately decided to accept it and commit to working on it throughout the 2022-2023 school year.</p>
